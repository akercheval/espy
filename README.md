# espy

### pypy, in Spanish!

In this directory I will be modifying the pypy source code to operate using 
Spanish, in everything from the keywords to the error messages. This will
be different from the python version of [sí](https://github.com/akercheval/si),
because while sí is a preprocessor that changes the language from English to 
Spanish (and vice-versa), espy will be, at its core, in Spanish. 

This is part of my senior honors thesis at Tufts University, but naturally the
code will be open-source. I'll upload a version of the thesis to this repository
in May 2018, once it's published.

#### A warning: This code is not fully in Spanish yet. Until this message is removed, consider this repository nothing more than a Spanglish pypy that wouldn't be very much fun to use.
That said, if you want to see where I'm at progress-wise at any given point, feel
free to clone the repository, run `sh build`, and walk away from your computer for
literally an hour while this thing boots up.
