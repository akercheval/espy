-------Ctypes tests------

Unlike the other tests in the PyPy sources, these tests are assumed to run after the translation is complete.
Therefore, using the resulting binary, you can then call, for example:

/path/to/your_modified_pypy_binary pytest.py pypy/module/test_lib_pypy/ctypes_tests/test_libc.py

This also applies to any other test in ctypes_tests.
